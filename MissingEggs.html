            <article class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed space-y-6">
                <p>A few days ago, I gave someone a carton of duck eggs.</p>
                
                <p>That’s the fact. But the emotional weight, the aftershock, was much heavier than the object itself. One of the cartons I gave was missing three eggs. I didn’t know at the time. I was trying to be generous. My wife was asleep, I made the best decision I could. But when I found out later, something primal cracked open inside me. A subtle, sharp shame… the kind that doesn't shout but curls into my bones.</p>
                
                <p>Suddenly, it wasn’t about eggs. It was about being wrong. About being seen as careless, stupid, unreliable. That missing carton became symbolic of every moment I’ve ever feared I was a letdown. Not because someone yelled or criticized, but because somewhere deep in my nervous system, I’ve learned to associate imperfection with abandonment. With not being safe in relationships.</p>
                
                <p>And this time, like so many times before, my ego kicked in fast. It whispered: <em class="text-slate-900">Fix this. Control the story. Call them, explain, say why it happened. Don’t let them think less of you.</em></p>
                
                <p>But another voice, one quieter, wiser, rose up too. My intuition. It said: <strong class="font-medium text-slate-900">No. Let this be what it is. You made a small mistake. It’s not the end. You don’t need to prove anything right now.</strong></p>
                
                <p>That was the moment I realized what I was truly fighting. It wasn’t my friends’ judgment. It was my own exhaustion from trying to constantly preempt disappointment.</p>

                <div class="divider"></div>
                
                <p>I have built a life strategy around the idea that if I work hard enough, if I monitor myself closely enough, if I never drop a detail or forget an expectation, then maybe, just maybe, I’ll escape the pain of letting someone down. Because for someone like me, who navigates the world through the nonlinear rhythms of AuDHD, it sometimes feels like life is a maze built for neurotypicals, and I’ve been handed a blueprint written in a different language. And so I try to compensate.</p>
                
                <p>Not because I don’t trust myself, but because I’ve been trained, covertly, silently, to believe that others won’t trust me unless I overdeliver, every time.</p>
                
                <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-teal-500 pl-6 py-2 my-8 text-slate-600 italic">
                    This is the root of my insecurity: the belief that my basic way of functioning will inevitably frustrate or disappoint the people I care about most. And so I hold myself to standards that are inhuman. Not because I believe in excellence, but because I believe in survival through perfection.
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>But now I’m seeing the cost. The exhaustion. The constant background tension. The inability to rest inside myself.</p>
                
                <p>And what’s wild, what’s painful and beautiful, is that all of this came to the surface over a gift.</p>
                
                <p>Not a confrontation. Not a crisis. A gift.</p>
                
                <p>I tried to bless someone, and still ended up confronting the part of me that believes even my generosity is not enough unless it’s flawless.</p>

                <div class="divider"></div>

                <p>But maybe… the gift wasn’t the eggs.</p>
                
                <p>Maybe the gift was me. My presence. My heart. My intention. My offering, imperfect, human, real.</p>
                
                <p>And maybe this entire experience is an initiation into a deeper truth: That I can disappoint someone and still be lovable. That I can make a mistake and still be trusted. That my worth is not up for negotiation every time I forget something.</p>
                
                <p>Because now I see the pattern. The need to explain. The fear of being misunderstood. The reflex to overcorrect. These are not flaws. They are protective spells I’ve been casting over my life to avoid the pain of exclusion.</p>
                
                <p>But I don’t need those spells anymore. I need something softer. Truer. I need presence over performance. Intimacy over invulnerability.</p>
                
                <p>I want to live in a world where I can mess up a carton of eggs and still feel safe in love.</p>
                
                <p>I want to let go of the exhausting vigilance that tells me I have to out-perform my own wiring in order to be accepted.</p>
                
                <p>I want to trust that the people in my life love me, not just the polished version of me I present when everything goes right.</p>

                <div class="divider"></div>

                <p>And here’s the thing: I can live in that world. Because I’m already creating it.</p>
                
                <p>By sitting with this discomfort instead of running from it. By telling the truth instead of managing the optics. By realizing that every time I resist the urge to prove myself, I grow stronger.</p>
                
                <p>This mistake wasn’t a failure. It was an opening.</p>
                
                <p>It’s teaching me how to relax inside imperfection. How to bless my friends without needing to control how they receive it. How to show up as a whole, complex, beautiful being who is no longer afraid of disappointing people, because love, real love, can withstand the bruises.</p>
                
                <p>And yes, my heart is like a bruised orange. But bruises don’t mean broken. They mean touched.</p>
                
                <p>And maybe now… I can’t even feel the same kind of insecurity anymore. Because the deeper truth has taken root:</p>
