            <p>There was a time in my life when I couldn’t open the door to my own home without flinching. Maybe you know that feeling, that tight knot in your stomach, the heaviness that drops when you glance around and think, this isn’t right… and maybe I’m not either.</p>
            
            <p>I didn’t always feel that way. But life has a way of piling on, changes in routine, shifting roles, the slow creep of chaos. Suddenly, my house no longer felt like mine. I wasn’t creating a sanctuary. I was surviving in it. There were dishes in the sink that felt like accusations. Dust that whispered failure. Corners of neglect that made me feel unworthy, even dirty.</p>
            
            <p class="font-semibold text-stone-800 italic text-xl my-12 text-center">It wasn't just the mess. It was the shame.</p>
            
            <p>When friends would visit, I’d tense up. I’d try to hide things, the mildew in the bathroom, the smudges on the walls, the forgotten things shoved into closets. But what I really wanted to hide was the part of me that believed I had let it get this way. That I had let myself get this way.</p>
            
            <p>And that’s when something shifted.</p>
            
            <p>Not all at once. Not in some Instagram-worthy “before and after” kind of way. But in the quiet space between two thoughts. I realized I’d been trying to make my space look “presentable” for other people… but I’d never made it feel safe for myself.</p>

            <p>So I stopped scrubbing for perfection, and I started listening, not just to the creaks of the floor or the hum of the fridge, but to my own nervous system. I asked myself: What do I need to feel grounded here? What would make this room feel like a hug instead of a battleground?</p>
            
            <p>And slowly, I began to shift.</p>
            
            <p>I let go of the need to be “good enough” and chose to become present instead. Some days, that meant clearing off a single surface and lighting a candle. Other days, it meant pausing when I felt disgusted or triggered and asking, What is this really about? Mold, mildew, grime, yes, they’re real. But what hurt more was what they symbolized to me: neglect, depression, even decay.</p>
            
            <p>Instead of recoiling, I got curious.</p>
            
            <p>What if the feeling of repulsion was a message, not of failure, but of care? A signal that I deserve a space that feels dignified and alive? That I’m allowed to want joy, not just function?</p>
            
            <p>I started calling my house a “fun house”, not in the carnival sense, but like the dwelling of an eccentric magician. It was imperfect, yes. But also whimsical. I hung strange art. Let the clutter tell stories. Planted small things in mismatched pots. And when friends came over, they didn’t see the imperfections I feared. They saw character. They felt warmth.</p>
            
            <p>And slowly, I did too.</p>
            
            <p>Now when I feel that knot rise in my stomach, I pause. I breathe. I remind myself that being clean doesn't mean being sterile, and being present doesn’t mean being perfect. My house, like me, is allowed to be in process.</p>
            
            <p>If you’ve ever felt unworthy in your own space, if you’ve ever looked around and felt overwhelmed or ashamed, know this: you’re not alone. And you’re not broken. Sometimes the very things that feel like red flags are just invitations, to care more, to slow down, to turn toward the mess with gentleness and say, I see you. Let’s do this together.</p>
