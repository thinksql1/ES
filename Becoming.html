        <!-- The Story -->
        <article class="space-y-8 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            <p>Let me tell you a story, not of a hero who conquered the world, but of a quiet transformation that began on an ordinary day, after an interview.</p>

            <p>The man walked out of the building into a gray afternoon. The wind had picked up. It tugged at his jacket like a child begging for attention, insistent, invisible. He had just been told he was overqualified. It should have been flattering. It should have filled him with confidence. But instead, it unsettled something deep inside.</p>

            <p>As he walked to his car, he glanced at a job board on his phone: roles like Principal Solutions Architect, Director of Sales Engineering, Product Evangelist. Each title felt like a costume hanging in a closet too big for him. Grown-up shoes he was supposed to wear, but didn't believe he could fill.</p>

            <hr class="border-gray-700 my-10">

            <p>That’s when the voice came.</p>

            <blockquote class="story-blockquote my-8 space-y-2">
                <p>“You’re a phony,” it whispered.</p>
                <p>“They’re going to find out.”</p>
                <p>“You’re not ready.”</p>
                <p>“You’re not enough.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>He’d heard that voice before. We all have. But this time, instead of brushing it away or shouting over it, he paused. He felt it. He turned inward and found something he’d never seen so clearly: a dark, heavy presence, clinging to the back of him like a tumor made of shadow. It wasn’t physical; it was energetic. Dense with fear. Alive with doubt.</p>

            <p class="font-semibold text-white">And for the first time in his life… he didn’t run from it.</p>
            <p>He sat down, in the car, in the silence, and met it.</p>

            <p>He didn’t try to fix it. He didn’t try to banish it. He did something radical. He listened.</p>
            
            <p>He asked the voice why it was there. What it was protecting. What it needed.</p>

            <p class="text-xl text-center py-6 text-teal-300 tracking-wide">And in that tender, honest moment, something shifted.</p>

            <p>The rock began to dissolve, not because he fought it, but because he understood it. It wasn’t a tumor. It was a cocoon. And fear? Fear was just the heat of transformation.</p>

            <p>That’s when he saw it, the truth hidden inside the shame:</p>
            
            <div class="bg-gray-800/50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8 border border-gray-700">
                <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-center text-white font-medium">Imposter syndrome isn’t a signal that you’re pretending. It’s a sign that you’re <span class="text-teal-300">evolving.</span></p>
                <p class="text-center mt-2 text-gray-400">It’s what growth feels like when you haven’t caught up to your own expansion.</p>
            </div>

            <p>He began asking different questions:</p>

            <blockquote class="story-blockquote my-8 space-y-2">
                <p>What if this incompetence is just the first step of mastery?</p>
                <p>Can I move forward with fear, not in spite of it, but with it as a companion?</p>
                <p>Isn’t honesty with myself a deeper strength than pretending I have it all together?</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>With every question, he reclaimed his power. The fear became fuel. The shadow became light. And he… he became something new:</p>

            <p class="text-center text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold tracking-wider text-white py-4">
                Calm. Capable. Certain.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center text-lg text-gray-400 -mt-4">Fast, but rooted, like a tree struck by lightning and still standing.</p>

            <hr class="border-gray-700 my-10">

            <p>And now, he tells this story, not because he’s arrived, but because he remembers.</p>
            <p>He remembers that the version of himself he was most afraid to become, the one with power, with presence, with a voice, wasn’t a lie.</p>
            <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-white text-center py-4">It was a future self… calling him home.</p>
