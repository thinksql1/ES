                <div class="space-y-4 text-slate-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    <p>There comes a time in every life where the world no longer sees you clearly. When your worth is weighed against a budget, when your mastery is mistaken for something that can be replaced by software or a cheaper line item.</p>
                    <p>There was a season when I found myself standing in a room where my needs weren’t being considered. The air was thick with subtle persuasion, all in the name of saving money. Decisions were being made behind closed doors, and when they were brought to me, they weren’t conversations, they were conclusions.</p>
                    <p>And in that silence, I felt it: undervalued. Intimidated. Like the ground I stood on had started to dissolve.</p>
                    <p>I rated the intensity of that feeling an 8 out of 10. It wasn’t just about the license being taken or the budget being cut, it was about being made small in the face of systems that should have known better.</p>
                    <p class="font-semibold text-violet-300 italic mt-6">But what if that pain wasn’t weakness? What if it was a signal?</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-violet-400 mb-4 border-l-4 border-violet-400 pl-4">Listening to the Signal</h2>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">In the solitude of that experience, I did something most people avoid: I listened. I tuned in, like one listens to a storm through the walls. And in those internal echoes, I discovered truths I had buried under professionalism and politeness.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg italic text-slate-200">It’s not irrational to feel threatened when your contributions are being erased, it’s human.</p>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">These weren’t exaggerations. They were the voice of my integrity roaring back to life. And in that moment, I honored that voice.</p>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">Still, the storm didn’t pass overnight. I was stuck between anger and action. Part of me wanted to shout, “They should know better!”, like a kung-fu master being taunted by someone who has no idea who they’re messing with. But even that metaphor began to feel silly. Because this wasn’t about them. This was about me.</p>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">I saw what was happening systemically. The goal was to reduce the complexity of what I do until anyone could do it. But that strategy had a fatal flaw:</p>
                <p class="text-2xl font-bold text-center text-white my-6">You can’t replace soul.</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-center">And I? I bring soul.</p>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">That’s when something clicked. I stopped reacting and started creating. The energy that once fueled my distress became momentum. I began preparing, not just for a job change, but a destiny upgrade.</p>
