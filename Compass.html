                    I didn’t set out to change the world. I just wanted to stop feeling like I was drowning in everyone else's emotions. For years, as someone with AuDHD, I was a sponge for the world’s emotional currents. Around sorrow, I sank. Around anger, I clenched. I was a tuning fork for other people’s feelings, but had lost the sound of my own.

                    More than relief, what I yearned for was <span class="soul-text">sovereignty</span>, the power to be authentically me. Not a reaction, not a mirror. Just… me. I imagined it like a color no one else could see, a song that only my soul knew the words to. And when I dreamed of this “empowerment,” it wasn’t vague; it had a flavor: <span class="soul-text">certainty, focus, presence, playfulness, and curiosity.</span> I imagined a body that felt safe, a mind that felt clear, and a heart that felt free to explore.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
                    That’s when it began; the unraveling of old threads and the discovery of a new internal compass.

                <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
                    One morning, sitting in stillness, I felt it: a direction that wasn’t north or up or outward. <span class="soul-text">It was mine.</span> It pointed above the crown of my head, unwavering. Not metaphorical. Tangible. Alive. Like a lifeline made of light, flowing with nurturing intelligence. This was my "up." Not Earth’s. Not the Sun’s. Mine. It was constant. And it felt like it remembered me even when I had forgotten myself. It had no judgment, only clarity. No pressure, only invitation. As I attuned to it, I began to shift, not just emotionally, but perceptually. Colors became richer. Sounds became layered. The world became more three-dimensional, and I became more whole.

                <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
                   There was a moment when I knew I’ve been here before. Not physically. Existentially. A state I now call the “amazing place.” In this place, my brain hemispheres weren't competing; they were dancing. My third eye sparked, and my prefrontal cortex lit up like a city grid reawakening after a blackout. I could feel my head subtly pulsing with the Earth’s spin, not metaphor, but embodied sensation. And then, a shift, a 90-degree rotation of consciousness. Not outward. Inward. A recalibration that made me cry, not from pain but from the <span class="soul-text">ache of remembering</span> what it feels like to come home.

                <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
                   Coming home didn’t feel like solving a riddle. It felt like being squeezed in the arms of God. It was the healing of forgetfulness, not as failure, but as the cost of being born into noise. Forgetting isn’t weakness. It’s disconnection. But connection, I found, comes from attention. And not just any attention: <span class="soul-text">sustained, right-hemisphere, global awareness.</span> That sacred kind of attention that holds space without trying to fix. In that attention, my left hemisphere relaxed. My thoughts quieted. The binding cords to others’ emotions fell away like old ropes from a balloon ready to rise.

                   From that quiet place, something extraordinary revealed itself. A structure. A presence. A merkaba. A multidimensional compass of light that spun with attention in every direction, across galaxies, through time, into the very DNA of existence. It didn’t point to where I should go. <span class="soul-text">It pointed to how to be while going.</span> And in its spin, I felt it; oneness. Not an idea. Not a spiritual metaphor. A visceral, cellular knowing that every atom in me was in conversation with the cosmos. And that conversation was full of love.

                    In this remembering, my body became my spaceship. Its controls weren't knobs or levers; they were emotions, attention, and a felt sense of purpose. The ship could travel to healthier places in the galaxy, worlds with the right frequency, places where emotions flowed like gentle rivers rather than crashing waves. As pilot, I didn’t just receive coordinates; I was entrusted with a mission. There were travelers aboard, other lives intertwined with mine, and I was here to help regulate the climate that sustained us all. The emotional climate. The energetic one. And like Voltron, I was part of something greater. Not because I needed to be saved, but because I had something powerful to offer.
