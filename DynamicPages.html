                    Good morning. Or afternoon. Or evening. Whatever moment you're in, I invite you to step with me into a space between worlds. A space where <span class="highlight-text">technology meets the soul</span>, and the future reveals itself not just in code, but in feeling.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-fade">
                    Let me take you to the edge of something alive. A vision. A vision not of apps and data alone, but of living pages. Imagine it: application screens that respond like living beings, where datasets breathe and chatbots speak like sages, revealing insights as charts bloom like constellations. Not static. Not cold. But <span class="highlight-text">dynamic, fluid, elegant</span>. Like science fiction wrapped in silk. Pages that scroll messages like weather tickers, that visualize activity like atmospheric pressure. Interfaces that aren’t just helpful, but alive with beauty, rhythm, and story.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-fade">
                    And just when I thought this future was mine to engineer, a burst of memory.
                </p>
                <p class="font-semibold text-white text-2xl tracking-widest my-4 scroll-fade">
                    Jeff.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-fade">
                    My friend. Gone since 2018, but suddenly present. Not in body, but in voice, smile, sensation. As real as the electric hum of creation itself. We had no masks between us, Jeff and I. We were human, honest, unfiltered. In that memory, something opened. A doorway, unexpected.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-fade">
                    Grief didn’t crash in. Something else did.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-fade">
                    Cool peppermint clarity. A visualization I’d used before, a way to meet emotion rather than run. I followed it. Inward. Deeper. Until I found it:
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-fade">
                    A presence. Lithe and powerful, like a bobcat or mountain lion, circling the pineal gland. A light, radiant and sure, surrounded by icy snow, white and bright, cool to the touch of spirit. And when I let go, when I grounded the electricity into the earth, the emotion collapsed.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-fade">
                    All that remained? <span class="highlight-text">Peace. Balance. Lightness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-fade">
                    I was light as a feather, and I thrived.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-fade">
                    In that silence, something strange and beautiful occurred: my mind spoke in sparks. Words shot out like lightning from a glass sphere. A <span class="highlight-text">Tesla coil of consciousness</span>. Not sentences, but gestalts. Ideas, memories, emotions, all shimmering for mere seconds. Listen, and they come alive. Miss them, and they vanish.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-fade">
                    In this stillness, there was motion. A pull. Gravity. I felt it draw me forward, orbiting closer, until I realized: I was not being pulled. I was being invited.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-fade">
                    And at the center, unchanged, was something eternal. A spark. A flow of life. Not rushing, not waiting. Simply being. And from that center, came the propulsion to create.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-fade">
                    To build. To design. To dream into reality pages that not only work, but feel. Pages that sing and shimmer, that mirror the depth of the inner world we all carry.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-fade">
                    So this is not just about technology. This is not just about memory. It’s about becoming whole enough to build something worthy of the world. About letting grief and code and presence and pixels blend into something real.
                </p>
                <p class="font-semibold text-white scroll-fade">
                    This is how we create dynamic futures. Not only with tools, but with truth.
                </p>
                <p class="pt-4 text-gray-400 scroll-fade">
                    Thank you.
