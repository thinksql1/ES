                <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-center mb-10">I’d like to take you into a story, not just mine, but ours. A story about singing, but not the kind you rehearse in front of mirrors or perform under stage lights. This is about a deeper kind of song. The kind that remembers you when you’ve forgotten yourself. The kind that reaches beyond melody and harmony and stirs the soul awake.</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">It began quietly, in the most ordinary of places: rehearsal. I was in a Christian band, learning songs. The notes were there, the lyrics were fine, but something in me had gone silent. I couldn’t care. Not out of rebellion or laziness, but because something essential was missing. I wasn’t justasking how to sing better. I was asking:</p>

                    Where did the magic go?

                <div class="space-y-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    <p>That longing cracked open a door. In a session of deep listening, a sacred space, I asked myself not what to do, but what I was missing. What returned wasn’t instruction. It was memory.</p>
                    <p class="font-semibold text-purple-800/90">The magic wasn’t gone. It had just been waiting.</p>
                    <p>Magic, as I remembered it, wasn’t loud. It wasn’t about impressing anyone. It lived in those moments where I didn’t feel pressure to get it right, where emotion flowed not from control, but from surrender.</p>
                    <p>It was the soul responding to the gentle movement of Spirit, not an idea, but a living, breathing force within. And my body? It didn’t need to understand it. It knew it through nerve endings and presence, through a felt sense.</p>
                    <p>That felt sense lit a path to intuition. And that intuition revealed something holy: <span class="font-serif italic text-purple-600/90">A knowing of experience, flowing from Source, from All that is.</span></p>
                    <p>In that alignment of spirit, soul, body, and knowing, life unfolded. Not as theory. As my life. And it was rich. Vibrant. Beautiful.</p>

                    <p>But magic doesn’t bloom in isolation. It requires something precious: Safety. Connection. Belonging.</p>
                    <p>Just before the magic returns, I feel safe among others. Not just socially, but spiritually:</p>

                    <p>This is what we call the <span class="font-semibold">Field of Unity.</span> It’s a place of magnetic awareness, alive in us and through us.</p>
                    <p>And in this field, the song isn’t sung by me. <br><span class="text-2xl font-serif italic text-purple-600/90">It sings through me.</span></p>
                    <p>My voice, my body, my being, all are animated. I become part of something larger: a light emanating force, birthing not just harmony, but authentic community. And this community chooses something radical in today’s world: To surrender, grow, and move as one.</p>
